# Recipe-Classification

The goal of this project is to predict which cuisine the recipe belongs to on the basis of it's ingredients.
Using R, we have developed a model that tests the accuracy of decision trees and then random forests in predicting.
Decision trees gave an accuracy of 0.41 while random forests gave 0.73.
